OF EVICTION</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although the
consequences of eviction are many and multidimensional, this
testimony focuses on eviction’s consequences for employment,
physical health, mental health, material hardship, and neighborhood
disadvantage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Employment</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Many people think
that job loss leads to eviction, but eviction can also lead to job
loss. An eviction not only can consume renters’ time, causing them
to miss work, it also can consume their thoughts and cause them to
make mistakes on the job, and also result in their relocating farther
away from their worksite, increasing their likelihood of tardiness
and absenteeism. A recent study found that workers who involuntarily
lost their housing were roughly 20 percent more likely subsequently
lose their jobs, compared to similar workers who did not. These
results imply that initiatives promoting housing stability could
promote employment stability.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Physical Health</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Involuntary housing
displacement is linked to substandard housing conditions. One
explanation for why some poor families live in substandard housing
conditions—which among other things harms children’s health—is
that they are compelled to do so in the aftermath of an eviction. The
American Journal of Public Health has called inadequate housing “a
public health crisis.” A significant body of research has linked
poor housing conditions to a wide array of health problems, from
asthma, lead poisoning, and respiratory complications to
developmental delays, heart disease, severe skin diseases, and
neurological disorders. These facts are not lost on the poor. A
survey of families on the list for rent assistance found that almost
half believed their children’s health had suffered on account of
the expense or quality of their apartments.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Mental Health</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Eviction is also
negatively associated with mental health. Drawing on the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study—a national, longitudinal survey
that follows a birth cohort of about 4,900 new parents and their
children living in 20 large cities—one study found that the year
following an eviction, mothers are 20 percent more likely to report
depression than their peers. Moreover, at least two years after their
eviction, mothers still experienced significantly higher rates of
depression than their peers. The mental health consequences of what
might seem like run-of-the-mill evictions can be fatal. A 2015 study
in the American Journal of Public Health examined nearly 1,000
suicides in which eviction or foreclosure were key causal stressors
leading to untimely deaths. Most of those deaths occurred before the
home was actually lost, but often occurred within two weeks of a
court proceeding related to the foreclosure of eviction. Eviction- or
foreclosure-related suicides accounted for 10-16% of all financial
related suicides recorded in a national database between 2005 and
2010.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Material Hardship</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The Fragile Families
study also documented a large and robust relationship between a
recent eviction and increased material hardship, defined as the
inability to meet basic food, clothing, and medical needs. Mothers
who experienced an eviction in the last year report around one
standard deviation higher rates of material hardship than mothers who
were matched along many other characteristics but had not experienced
eviction. As with depression, mothers’ material hardship may also
be affected in the long-term, as significant differences were
detected at least two years after the event. If material hardship is
a measure of the lived experience of scarcity—assessing, say,
hunger or sickness because food or medical care was financially out
of reach—then these findings suggest that eviction is a driver of
poverty.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Neighborhood
Disadvantage </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Experiencing an
eviction is associated with a significant increase in neighborhood
poverty and crime rates, relative to voluntary moves. Families
involuntarily displaced from their homes often end up in worse
neighborhoods, neighborhoods that worsen children’s life chances.
An eviction judgment makes it difficult to secure decent housing in a
safe neighborhood, as many landlords reject anyone with a recent
eviction, even if they have no idea why the eviction occurred.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
On an aggregate level, eviction may contribute to neighborhood crime
and violence. Preliminary findings show that neighborhoods with
higher eviction rates have higher violent crime rates the following
year, even controlling for the previous year’s violent crime rate.
In these ways, the pains of eviction are felt by more than the
individuals who lose their homes. These consequences are borne by
entire communities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Forced moves are
both prevalent and consequential. If housing instability is a
wellspring for multiple social problems, then policy or legal
interventions to decrease evictions should benefit families and
communities along multiple pros-social dimensions.</p>
