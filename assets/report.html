</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Although
the consequences of eviction are many and multidimensional, this
testimony focuses on eviction’s consequences for employment,
physical health, mental health, material hardship, and neighborhood
disadvantage.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Employment</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Many
people think that job loss leads to eviction, but eviction can also
lead to job loss. An eviction not only can consume renters’ time,
causing them to miss work, it also can consume their thoughts and
cause them to make mistakes on the job, and also result in their
relocating farther away from their worksite, increasing their
likelihood of tardiness and absenteeism. A recent study found that
workers who involuntarily lost their housing were roughly 20 percent
more likely subsequently lose their jobs, compared to similar workers
who did not. These results imply that initiatives promoting housing
stability could promote employment stability.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Physical
Health</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Involuntary
housing displacement is linked to substandard housing conditions. One
explanation for why some poor families live in substandard housing
conditions—which among other things harms children’s health—is
that they are compelled to do so in the aftermath of an eviction. The
American Journal of Public Health has called inadequate housing “a
public health crisis.” A significant body of research has linked
poor housing conditions to a wide array of health problems, from
asthma, lead poisoning, and respiratory complications to
developmental delays, heart disease, severe skin diseases, and
neurological disorders. These facts are not lost on the poor. A
survey of families on the list for rent assistance found that almost
half believed their children’s health had suffered on account of
the expense or quality of their apartments.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Mental
Health</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Eviction
is also negatively associated with mental health. Drawing on the
Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study—a national, longitudinal
survey that follows a birth cohort of about 4,900 new parents and
their children living in 20 large cities—one study found that the
year following an eviction, mothers are 20 percent more likely to
report depression than their peers. Moreover, at least two years
after their eviction, mothers still experienced significantly higher
rates of depression than their peers. The mental health consequences
of what might seem like run-of-the-mill evictions can be fatal. A
2015 study in the American Journal of Public Health examined nearly
1,000 suicides in which eviction or foreclosure were key causal
stressors leading to untimely deaths. Most of those deaths occurred
before the home was actually lost, but often occurred within two
weeks of a court proceeding related to the foreclosure of eviction.
Eviction- or foreclosure-related suicides accounted for 10-16% of all
financial related suicides recorded in a national database between
2005 and 2010.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Material
Hardship</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Fragile Families study also documented a large and robust
relationship between a recent eviction and increased material
hardship, defined as the inability to meet basic food, clothing, and
medical needs. Mothers who experienced an eviction in the last year
report around one standard deviation higher rates of material
hardship than mothers who were matched along many other
characteristics but had not experienced eviction. As with depression,
mothers’ material hardship may also be affected in the long-term,
as significant differences were detected at least two years after the
event. If material hardship is a measure of the lived experience of
scarcity—assessing, say, hunger or sickness because food or medical
care was financially out of reach—then these findings suggest that
eviction is a driver of poverty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Neighborhood
Disadvantage </b>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Experiencing
an eviction is associated with a significant increase in neighborhood
poverty and crime rates, relative to voluntary moves. Families
involuntarily displaced from their homes often end up in worse
neighborhoods, neighborhoods that worsen children’s life chances.
An eviction judgment makes it difficult to secure decent housing in a
safe neighborhood, as many landlords reject anyone with a recent
eviction, even if they have no idea why the eviction occurred.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
On an aggregate level, eviction may contribute to neighborhood crime
and violence. Preliminary findings show that neighborhoods with
higher eviction rates have higher violent crime rates the following
year, even controlling for the previous year’s violent crime rate.
In these ways, the pains of eviction are felt by more than the
individuals who lose their homes. These consequences are borne by
entire communities.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Forced
moves are both prevalent and consequential. If housing instability is
a wellspring for multiple social problems, then policy or legal
interventions to decrease evictions should benefit families and
communities along multiple pros-social dimensions.</p>
